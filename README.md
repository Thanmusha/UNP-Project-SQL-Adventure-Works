# UNP-Project-SQL-Adventure-Works
Completed this Project as a Part of my Internship with United Network of Professionals (UNP).

Key Highlights:

Implementation of primary key and foreign key relationships for data integrity.
Data Transformation in Backup Database
Migration of data from the original to the backup database while ensuring data consistency.
Formulation of SQL queries for business intelligence purposes.
Data Migration to Original Database
Retrieval of critical business insights, such as total customers, product sub-category sales contributions, top products by profit, and territory-wise sales.
These steps collectively demonstrate database management, data transformation, and the execution of analytical queries to extract meaningful insights from the Adventure Works dataset.
